# IVD_Core - GTA IV Roleplay Framework (Alpha)
IVD_Core is a work-in-progress roleplay framework for GTA IV, designed to bring structured roleplay mechanics to the game. While it's still in early alpha, we are actively developing it to create a complete and immersive RP experience.

This framework lays the foundation for roleplay servers, providing essential core functionalities, database integration, and future expansion capabilities.

# üîß Setting Up MySQL
Before running the server, you need to configure your MySQL database connection. To do this, update the credentials inside:

```
/server/main.lua
```
Modify the following line with your database details:

```
-- MYSQL LOGIN --
MySQL.Connect("IP", 33060, "DATABASE", "PASSWORD", "DATABASE")
```
Make sure to replace IP, DATABASE, and PASSWORD with your actual database information. This step is crucial for proper data storage and retrieval.

# üöÄ Future Development
We are actively working on expanding IVD_Core with:

* Character systems (player creation, inventory, etc.)
* Job systems (police, medic, criminal activities)
* Advanced UI elements for better user interaction
* Vehicle and property systems
* Full-fledged economy integration

As this is an alpha release, expect frequent updates and improvements as we move towards a complete RP framework.
